* Task: Write a program to read in two strings at a time. Find the first string in a
*       list<string> and insert the second string immediately after the first one. If the first
*       string isn't found, insert the second string at the end of the list. Finally, copy the
*       final list<string> into a vector<string>. Now sort both the list and the vector and
*       assert that their content is equal.
